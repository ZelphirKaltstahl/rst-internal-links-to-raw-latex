# rst-internal-links-to-raw-latex
This repository contains a Python 3 program, which parses reStructuredText files and converts document internal links to reStructuredText raw latex hypertargets and hyperlinks. This enables document internal links in PDFs when using Pandoc to compile PDFs from reStructuredText files.
